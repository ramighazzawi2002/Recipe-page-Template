# Recipe Page

This is a simple recipe page built with HTML and CSS.

## Structure

The project has the following structure:
assets/ fonts/ outfit/ OFL.txt Outfit-VariableFont_wght.ttf README.txt static/ Outfit-Black.ttf Outfit-Bold.ttf Outfit-ExtraBold.ttf Outfit-ExtraLight.ttf Outfit-Light.ttf Outfit-Medium.ttf Outfit-Regular.ttf Outfit-SemiBold.ttf Outfit-Thin.ttf young-serif/ OFL.txt YoungSerif-Regular.ttf images/ index.html

## Fonts

The project uses two custom fonts: 'Outfit' and 'Young Serif'.

'Outfit' is a variable font with a `wght` axis, meaning all the styles are contained in a single file: `Outfit-VariableFont_wght.ttf`. If your app doesn't fully support variable fonts, you can use the static font files for 'Outfit' located in the `static/` directory.

'Young Serif' is a regular font used for specific stylings.

Please read the full license text in `OFL.txt` for each font to understand the permissions, restrictions, and requirements for usage, redistribution, and modification.

## Styles

The `index.html` file contains some basic styles for the page. The body of the page has a background color of `hsl(30, 54%, 90%)` and uses flexbox for centering and alignment. The font size for the body is set to `16px`.

## Usage

To use this project, simply open the `index.html` file in your browser.
